An application like this collects data from a website on the internet and stores the information at a desired place where user can access it.  In this application, a results website is scraped, and the results related to any specified person are taken. Then, the person’s results in the sheet are served to the client in an organised way .  This is helpful for any user who wants to keep a track of their results or to keep a record of them. It saves the time of the student by collecting all the important information. This project is coded in Python using several modules and designed by PyQtDesigner.
